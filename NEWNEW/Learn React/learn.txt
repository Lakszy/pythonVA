*Life Cycle of a Components*
Constructed -> Mounted->Updated->UnMounted

->like when we add items in cart Updated
navigate on other screen it gets unMounted


*HOOKS*

->States don't share the memory they are
stored in the local storage 


const[val,setVal]=useState(0)

->this means we have an array on 0 th index
we have the value and on the 1st index'
we have the function()
zero means the initial value of the value

useState(like storing a variable)
->A state of a components is a variable 
that holds some information that 
may change over the lifetime of the components

->whenever value of the  state chnages the 
components get re ernder the *whole* components





useEffect()
in simple words this can be used
whenever we want to perform a functionality
during the Mount Or The UnMount 
i.e. during the state change of an components
